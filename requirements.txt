# Core dependencies for all quantization features
torch>=2.0.0
safetensors>=0.3.1
tqdm>=4.65.0
numpy>=1.17.0

# Additional dependencies for ControlNet FP8 quantization

# Additional dependencies for GGUF quantization
# Note: GGUF package is included in the gguf/ directory (from City96's tools)
# The following are required for GGUF functionality:
huggingface_hub>=0.16.0
requests>=2.28.0

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
# These are recommended but not strictly required:
# sentencepiece>=0.1.98  # For advanced GGUF model processing
# pyyaml>=5.1            # For configuration file support

# System requirements for GGUF quantization:
# - Minimum 96GB RAM (for large diffusion models)
# - CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
# - Python 3.8+ with PyTorch 2.0+
# - Sufficient storage space for temporary files during processing
